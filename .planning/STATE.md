## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Stack is Next.js 16 (SSG) + Tailwind + Zustand + PapaParse + Scryfall API + Resend
- [Roadmap]: Static site with build-time Scryfall enrichment (not runtime) to respect rate limits
- [Roadmap]: Zero database -- card data generated at build time from CSV
- [01-01]: Composite dedup key: setCode-collectorNumber-foil-condition for distinct card listings
- [01-01]: String-coerce collectorNumber from PapaParse dynamicTyping to avoid numeric type mismatch
- [01-02]: No name+set fallback needed: SLD high collector numbers resolve via standard Scryfall endpoint
- [01-02]: Price fallback chain: usd -> usd_foil -> usd_etched -> null covers all printings

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Resend free tier limits need verification at signup (Phase 5)
